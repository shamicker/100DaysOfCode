So, I had restarted Round 1 just before my home internet was out for almost 3 weeks!! So here I am at the beginning again. Here's to the next 100 days, which should take me to Jan 19th. We'll see about Xmas...

Today I just reviewed Python via DataQuest. Re-learned list.count(item). I love list/dict comprehensions.
