Whoops, didn't even realize I forgot to post 2 days straight!

More SQL queries and charting the results. Day 6 charted the queries, Day 7 organized my presentation, Day 8 troubleshot a couple errors. And here I thought I would be submitting on day7. Tomorrow will be re-verifying and submitting. :)

Spent too long trying to figure out an SQL query. But I did finally figure it out!

Yesterday and today were more Python review. I am at the part where it's technically still review, but from so long ago that I don't remember much (today ended with Classes). It's getting challenging, and I'm looking forward to more. :)

Today was a bit tough. I'd gone for drinks and really didn't want to work tipsily. BUT I promised myself I'd do my darnedest to do 100 days of coding. So my hour was doing more DataQuest - I'm really liking it, and I love how it's applying things I should know in a real-world way! So far we're "learning" lists and functions and such by manipulating a csv file. I probably have already done lots of this, but never with actual data like this. It's quite encouraging for getting my own data (it's the confidence to actually GET my own data that it's inspiring. The code is mostly review, so I'm practicing a lot of it as list/dict comprehensions.)

So, I had restarted Round 1 just before my home internet was out for almost 3 weeks!! So here I am at the beginning again. Here's to the next 100 days, which should take me to Jan 19th. We'll see about Xmas...

Today I just reviewed Python via DataQuest. Re-learned list.count(item). I love list/dict comprehensions.

Also spent about 2 hours figuring out why, how to fix, and updating all my code/links for github not showing my contributions! It's now all done and showing up. I'll finally see my contributions on my profile, which will be added motivation. Yay!!
