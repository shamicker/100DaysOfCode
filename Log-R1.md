Still struggling with the algorithm from yesterday. Discovered I'd missed a pretty big concept in it. Now working to wrap my brain around the actual grasping of what-goes-where in the math of it.

Also brushed up on some linear algebra, which may help with it.

Phew, learned a lot today.
Did a bit of PyTorch, but got rather lost trying to write out an algorithm using numpy, which I don't know very well at all. So watched a beginner's video from SciPyConf2018, which was fantastic! I'd been considering reviewing linear algebra but I think it covered enough that I won't have to (until later, probably). 

Gotta finish Daredevil s3 before my subscription is up!

Okay. I need to be strapped into this wagon; I keep falling off!
Oct 27-30: a half-assed 4 days, trying to get my head clear enough to think logically
Oct 31-Nov 1: I took off to help pack, clean, send off my brother's family
Nov 2: Learned I was accepted into the PyTorch Scholarship Challenge and was flustered again! Couldn't sit still, although I got a bit of DataQuest done.
Nov 3-8: Took off to visit my brother and help him & his young family unpack! With 2 little kids underfoot, I didn't get any coding done. :(
Nov 9-10: Started the PyTorch Challenge. So much to learn, plus a project at the end! Excited! Also finally got my last project reviewed. Contacted support about my ID not being supported in order to graduate DFND.

Okay, from now on (again), I'll be posting daily!!

Whoa, the week flew by and I didn't post!
I skipped a day to help someone pack house.
The last 4 days were spent trying to figure out project 4. I'm nearly there.
Also did a bit of DataQuest today.

Today's session was replaced by a career change webinar and then some online networking. Had a short but great chat with a new connection (who lives in New Zealand! Someday I'll see it for myself.)

Submitted SQL project and passed. Yay :)

Worked on some of the next chapter, and some of a Udemy ML course.

Whoops, didn't even realize I forgot to post 2 days straight!

More SQL queries and charting the results. Day 6 charted the queries, Day 7 organized my presentation, Day 8 troubleshot a couple errors. And here I thought I would be submitting on day7. Tomorrow will be re-verifying and submitting. :)

Spent too long trying to figure out an SQL query. But I did finally figure it out!

Yesterday and today were more Python review. I am at the part where it's technically still review, but from so long ago that I don't remember much (today ended with Classes). It's getting challenging, and I'm looking forward to more. :)

Today was a bit tough. I'd gone for drinks and really didn't want to work tipsily. BUT I promised myself I'd do my darnedest to do 100 days of coding. So my hour was doing more DataQuest - I'm really liking it, and I love how it's applying things I should know in a real-world way! So far we're "learning" lists and functions and such by manipulating a csv file. I probably have already done lots of this, but never with actual data like this. It's quite encouraging for getting my own data (it's the confidence to actually GET my own data that it's inspiring. The code is mostly review, so I'm practicing a lot of it as list/dict comprehensions.)

So, I had restarted Round 1 just before my home internet was out for almost 3 weeks!! So here I am at the beginning again. Here's to the next 100 days, which should take me to Jan 19th. We'll see about Xmas...

Today I just reviewed Python via DataQuest. Re-learned list.count(item). I love list/dict comprehensions.

Also spent about 2 hours figuring out why, how to fix, and updating all my code/links for github not showing my contributions! It's now all done and showing up. I'll finally see my contributions on my profile, which will be added motivation. Yay!!
