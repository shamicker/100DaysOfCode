Some DataCamp. 

Some pytorch challenge - understand backpropagation. Submitted my student story.

Didn't feel like much got done today. I did solve yesterday's issue. Now I'm on the next one. :)

Exciting!!! All of a sudden I'm working with this type of data. Unimaginable a couple months ago!

PS. I was so excited I forgot to add my #pytorchUdacityScholar and #WomenWhoCode tags :P

Did some minimal challenge work (a single chapter), but progress was made.
Really awful dull, bland headaches.

I'm just so fatigued these days; can't concentrate, etc. Need to get out & have a fun day off...

More @DataCamp! 

Job search document. It isn't coding, but currently more important than. I'd rather lump it in this challenge rather than have it turn into its own 100Days. I'm just so bad at selling. Especially myself.

Did some coding but still struggling on this. There's something I'm really missing. Maybe it'll come to me in my dreams.

Yay 1: I'd been struggling with taking digital math notes all week but got them working today.

Yay 2: I understand all the math steps and can finally move on in the challenge. ...Which is coding all these math steps! I'll start at it tomorrow and see how far I can go :)

Finished my chapter in DataCamp - I don't want to let that scholarship go to waste! I have planned out my time for it: roughly an hour a day for the 3 months should get me to the end of the Data Scientist in Python track!

Also, I finally attended an All-Girl Hack Night event - by myself! I was keenly interested in both talks being presented so wasn't even nervous!! :) The first was Our Unconscious Bias (like, in general), and the other was A.I. in Music. Pretty neat stuff! I bolted when it was over though. I might bring a friend next time...

Next to no progress on PyTorch challenge. :(

And I hear rumours that this is a harder part of the challenge, the foundational stuff. Phew! :)

In order to learn partial derivatives, I have to check out logarithms and multivariable calculus. Still working on that. Have I mentioned I'm happy to be back learning math?

Also spending a horrible amount of time trying to install latextools for sublime. I think I'm nearly done... again.

Still reviewing derivatives, but now I'm approaching a limit! It is also approaching what I need to know in order to continue on in the challenge.

Also, super excited to be a recipient of DataCamp's 3-month scholarship for women & minorities!!! Whoo hoo! :)

Another algorithm. Spent too long on it, but finally got it. I need more practice in python: I have trouble "translating" from math to python, even though I can read and explain both (thus far).

Brushed up on matrices on Khan Academy (he's a great teacher!)
Finally figured out the algorithm that was bugging me!! It was relatively simple piece I was missing...
Continued in PyTorch course. Yay!

Still struggling with the algorithm from yesterday. Discovered I'd missed a pretty big concept in it. Now working to wrap my brain around the actual grasping of what-goes-where in the math of it.

Also brushed up on some linear algebra, which may help with it.

Phew, learned a lot today.
Did a bit of PyTorch, but got rather lost trying to write out an algorithm using numpy, which I don't know very well at all. So watched a beginner's video from SciPyConf2018, which was fantastic! I'd been considering reviewing linear algebra but I think it covered enough that I won't have to (until later, probably). 

Gotta finish Daredevil s3 before my subscription is up!

Okay. I need to be strapped into this wagon; I keep falling off!
Oct 27-30: a half-assed 4 days, trying to get my head clear enough to think logically
Oct 31-Nov 1: I took off to help pack, clean, send off my brother's family
Nov 2: Learned I was accepted into the PyTorch Scholarship Challenge and was flustered again! Couldn't sit still, although I got a bit of DataQuest done.
Nov 3-8: Took off to visit my brother and help him & his young family unpack! With 2 little kids underfoot, I didn't get any coding done. :(
Nov 9-10: Started the PyTorch Challenge. So much to learn, plus a project at the end! Excited! Also finally got my last project reviewed. Contacted support about my ID not being supported in order to graduate DFND.

Okay, from now on (again), I'll be posting daily!!

Whoa, the week flew by and I didn't post!
I skipped a day to help someone pack house.
The last 4 days were spent trying to figure out project 4. I'm nearly there.
Also did a bit of DataQuest today.

More SQL queries and charting the results. Day 6 charted the queries, Day 7 organized my presentation, Day 8 troubleshot a couple errors. And here I thought I would be submitting on day7. Tomorrow will be re-verifying and submitting. :)

Yesterday and today were more Python review. I am at the part where it's technically still review, but from so long ago that I don't remember much (today ended with Classes). It's getting challenging, and I'm looking forward to more. :)

Today was a bit tough. I'd gone for drinks and really didn't want to work tipsily. BUT I promised myself I'd do my darnedest to do 100 days of coding. So my hour was doing more DataQuest - I'm really liking it, and I love how it's applying things I should know in a real-world way! So far we're "learning" lists and functions and such by manipulating a csv file. I probably have already done lots of this, but never with actual data like this. It's quite encouraging for getting my own data (it's the confidence to actually GET my own data that it's inspiring. The code is mostly review, so I'm practicing a lot of it as list/dict comprehensions.)

So, I had restarted Round 1 just before my home internet was out for almost 3 weeks!! So here I am at the beginning again. Here's to the next 100 days, which should take me to Jan 19th. We'll see about Xmas...

Today I just reviewed Python via DataQuest. Re-learned list.count(item). I love list/dict comprehensions.

Also spent about 2 hours figuring out why, how to fix, and updating all my code/links for github not showing my contributions! It's now all done and showing up. I'll finally see my contributions on my profile, which will be added motivation. Yay!!
