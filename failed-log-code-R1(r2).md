Okay. It was a bad time to start this challenge - home internet will be out for a week or two! I'll see what I can do, still.

Missed yesterday.
Today, revamped cv and answered prep questions for the SQL project.

My Little Robot Friend arrived today, so was pretty distracted settling it in (aka downloading its software) and reacquainting with it. I need to find it a name! :)

Elsewhere, just answering the pre-project3 (SQL) questions in DFND. Gotta get to the actual project now!

I'm committing to starting 100 days all over again. Too many falls, but I'm back for good! This time it'll be more data oriented.

**Feels**: I'm happy to have a tangible goal again.
