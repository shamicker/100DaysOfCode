## My pledge

### I have:
- joined the [coding slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/100xcode/shared_invite/enQtMzA2NzUyODY4MTgyLWM2NzMzYzBmZTcwOTk0MzM2YTI5OWQzM2M3ZTVjZTUyMTE0NDk3ZjdiZmExNGU5Mjg3ODgzZTQxODI3YTNjZjA)
- read  this article: [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)
- forked this repo
- changed the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day I started the challenge
- deleted the examples in the coding log
- publicly committed myself to the coding challenge by [tweeting it the world](https://twitter.com/hahaha_it_is_i/status/992443180971937793)

### I am:
- following the [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

### I will:
- **code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
- **tweet my progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
- **encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
- commit to the [current log](log-code-R1.md) (R1 stands for Round 1) daily.
- submit a Pull Request to add to the repo if I find a great, helpful resource that would benefit others.

### Similarly, for Focus I will:
- commit to better focus in multiple ways:
    - eating more greens, all-round healthier
    - drink plenty of water
    - exercise (cardio and strength) and/or meditate daily
    - get outdoors/ fresh air
    - socialize at least once a week
- log my progress [here](log-focus-R1.md) (and possibly tweet about it via #100daysOfHealth)


## Want to join or change your habits?

Check out [the #100DaysOfX Challenges Project](http://100daysofx.com/). By changing your habits you are changing your life. Remember that the best time to start is always NOW.

It's recommended to commit to no more than 2-3 challenges at a time, ideally 2. If you are doing the #100DaysOfCode which involves a lot of mental activity, try the [#100DaysOfHealth](http://100daysofx.com/where-x-is/health/), or [#100DaysOfFitness](http://100daysofx.com/challenges/) challenges. There is so much more on the site, check all of them out and choose the ones you want to acquire! Languages, writing, meditation, journaling, cooking, and more!
