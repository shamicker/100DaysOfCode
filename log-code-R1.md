Took time out from struggling with FEND memory game (the cards are flipping both left and right, one for each side). Did project 1 from JavaScript30 challenge - keyboard 'drumkit'.
- learned about the `<audio>` tag. Nice!
- learned about JS `transition end`. Whaa!? This could be the solution to the card flipping issue!!

**Feels**: extremely tired (it's after midnight and I usually go to bed around 10), but very glad I did a bit of coding. I spent more time figuring out how I want to format tweets/blogs/log than actual coding. Whatever, it's day1. So much to learn!
