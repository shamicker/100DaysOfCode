Took time out from struggling with FEND memory game (the cards are flipping both left and right, one for each side). Did project 1 from JavaScript30 challenge - keyboard 'drumkit'.
- learned about the `<audio>` tag. Nice!
- learned about JS `transition end`. Whaa!? This could be the solution to the card flipping issue!!

**Feels**: extremely tired (it's after midnight and I usually go to bed around 10), but very glad I did a bit of coding. I spent more time figuring out how I want to format tweets/blogs/log than actual coding. Whatever, it's day1. So much to learn!

Tried helping someone else today. It was a string manipulation dependent on user input (a hangman game) that he was having trouble with. I ended up pretty much writing it out in JS pseudo code for him. In my mind, it was 99% literally spelled out and he just had to replace my words with his variables (but I didn't say so). He wasn't getting it, and seemed like he just wanted the answer, which I am against providing.

Ironically, this is pretty much my exact struggle with the memory game. I have now written it out in paragraph pseudo code, but still can't grasp how I need to implement it! I know I can get it, it's just a matter of getting in some quality focus.

Disappointed in my lack of focus today.
But I downloaded Visual Studio Code to see what all the buzz was about. Whoa! I'm definitely going to make the switch! Once you get through a lot of configuration, EVERYTHING is right there. Overwhelmed by it, but ready to dig in. It'll save me so much time in the long run, I think. Especially things with it's tooltips on function definitions, github buttons, stack overflow... I could go on and on and I haven't even started using it yet!

Today was the first day of the Bertelsmann Data Science Challenge Scholarship. And thousands of us were really eager to get started, so Facebook was overwhelmingly busy asking if emails should be received yet, or if the forum or slack or the classrooms were open yet. And then when they WERE opened, oh geez!

But no actual coding happened there. Just a heck of a lot of online socializing. I had a short nap afterwards (plus I'm sick).

So I figured I should get some real coding in. So I did days 2 & 3 of JavaScript30. Implemented the 3 hands of an analog clock, and learned about CSS variables. Very cool! I look forward to trying those out!!

Also, coding went slower than usual because I'm trying out VSCode. Another late night.

Missed a couple days due to illness, but on the mend. Yesterday & today I did some Descriptive Statistics.

Today I did a little #JavaScript30 "array cardio" to get back into shape.
Those array methods (sort, map, filter, reduce) are tough but will make me stronger!
