Took time out from struggling with FEND memory game (the cards are flipping both left and right, one for each side). Did project 1 from JavaScript30 challenge - keyboard 'drumkit'.
- learned about the `<audio>` tag. Nice!
- learned about JS `transition end`. Whaa!? This could be the solution to the card flipping issue!!

**Feels**: extremely tired (it's after midnight and I usually go to bed around 10), but very glad I did a bit of coding. I spent more time figuring out how I want to format tweets/blogs/log than actual coding. Whatever, it's day1. So much to learn!

Tried helping someone else today. It was a string manipulation dependent on user input (a hangman game) that he was having trouble with. I ended up pretty much writing it out in JS pseudo code for him. In my mind, it was 99% literally spelled out and he just had to replace my words with his variables (but I didn't say so). He wasn't getting it, and seemed like he just wanted the answer, which I am against providing.

Ironically, this is pretty much my exact struggle with the memory game. I have now written it out in paragraph pseudo code, but still can't grasp how I need to implement it! I know I can get it, it's just a matter of getting in some quality focus.

Disappointed in my lack of focus today.
But I downloaded Visual Studio Code to see what all the buzz was about. Whoa! I'm definitely going to make the switch! Once you get through a lot of configuration, EVERYTHING is right there. Overwhelmed by it, but ready to dig in. It'll save me so much time in the long run, I think. Especially things with it's tooltips on function definitions, github buttons, stack overflow... I could go on and on and I haven't even started using it yet!

Today was the first day of the Bertelsmann Data Science Challenge Scholarship. And thousands of us were really eager to get started, so Facebook was overwhelmingly busy asking if emails should be received yet, or if the forum or slack or the classrooms were open yet. And then when they WERE opened, oh geez!

But no actual coding happened there. Just a heck of a lot of online socializing. I had a short nap afterwards (plus I'm sick).

So I figured I should get some real coding in. So I did days 2 & 3 of JavaScript30. Implemented the 3 hands of an analog clock, and learned about CSS variables. Very cool! I look forward to trying those out!!

Also, coding went slower than usual because I'm trying out VSCode. Another late night.

Missed a couple days due to illness, but on the mend. Yesterday & today I did some Descriptive Statistics.

Today I did a little #JavaScript30 "array cardio" to get back into shape.
Those array methods (sort, map, filter, reduce) are tough but will make me stronger!

Still a little under the weather so missed a day. Yesterday and today I did more Descriptive Statistics rather than *actual* coding. But I'm counting it since it'll eventually become coding. Can't wait for that part!

More Descriptive Stats today. I've gotten to the new-to-me stuff! I learned about:
- bar charts vs histograms
- intervals/ bins/ buckets
- frequencies and distributions

I'd forgotten just how much I like math. I'm loving Descriptive Stats! Of course, it's still early on.

Also figured out how to write math symbols in my markdown sheet. Exciting!

Nothing terribly interesting has been happening. Just plugging away in Descriptive Statistics. Loving it, but it's still mostly a review of my math days. Granted, they seem like a million years ago...

Alright. I dropped the ball. I missed a few days, but I'm back!
And with a plan (literally a schedule, which I never do, but I need to really buckle down).

Leapt back to the memory game I'd been avoiding. Solved my CSS transition issue and figured out how to implement my pseudo code! Yeah! Maybe I just needed a break?

Been plugging away at the FEND Memory Game. I feel so close to finishing it! Although, really, there's still more to implement and lots to fix, yet I'm tweaking the details. They're details that I'd probably end up tweaking anyways (like the flip speeds).

- tweaking card-flip speeds,
- implement the winner's popup,
- reworking code for replay, based on winner's popup input

And wow, I suck at design, hahaha! :)

Took an extended weekend off. But again, I'm back, with another plan. An additional plan. With a visual map of my goals! It hurts to look at all that I haven't done & all I still have left, but it is also motivation. I can and WILL do it!!

So today was lesson 15 of the data science challenge - learned about standardizing a normal distribution.

As well, I fiddled with my memory game a bit. Box shadows to make it a bit less completely 2D flat.

Missed a day again! Back though.

Finished 2 "chapters" of practice questions in the data science challenge. I'm understanding the stuff, and looking forward to more!

Another lesson down in stats!

Also did a lot of work for something that was obviously simple in the end. I guess sometimes I need to take the scenic route. :)

Only did lesson 19 and a bit of 20 in stats. I'll have to redo some of 20 since I'm not understanding it fully. No problem, but it's tomorrow's task.

Yesterday, did some minor but important progress on memory game. Felt awesome!

Today, progressing in stats, but am pretty confused! There was an abrupt line between material that was review and completely new, and I crossed it. Having trouble grasping the concept of the Central Limit Theorem and the Standard Error. But I've got more material to cover before I'll review it.

Implemented move counter and a running timer to the memory game, but I think something's not quite right with it. I'll finish those up tomorrow.

Yikes, I haven't worked on my own projects for a week!
Had to prep (clean and rearrange) my place for Dad's arrival, and then we were out of town a few days for a funeral.

Then I mentored a couple of long but fun days at #TeachersLearningCode, and got to check out #RoboCup2018!

Finished all the FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design tutorials. Just need to do the 5 projects!

Also figured out (read: installed) table of contents for markdown.

And finally, started reviewing the Sampling Distributions chapter in Descriptive Stats that I had so much trouble with. So far so good...

Took a day off for St Jean-Baptiste Monday holiday. Biked all afternoon with Kim. Sunburn! But fun and tiring. :)

Today, read some Data articles, poked around on Slack and the Forum for Data Challenge.
Tried to organize myself with the groups I've joined! I can't keep them straight, and am getting lost with all the info. Must do better.

Yay! Finished the Stats part of the Data Challenge. Understanding the 'how' but not the 'why' (which isn't in the course's scope) of sampling distributions.

Started on the Python part of the Challenge.

Discovered PythonAnywhere so went back and finally made my old 'fill in the blank quiz' live. It had been on the back burner for a long, long time.

- filter
- lambda expressions
- iterators
- generators

Currently stuck on a generator quiz, but I'll get it tomorrow. :)

During a break, I suddenly figured out the quiz I was stuck on. I was making it more difficult than it actually was. (Story of my life!)

However, I'm still convinced I have the tools to make it more concise. Still working on that.

I also read data articles, watched data & cv videos, organized my path a bit more.

Working too late in the evening means slower work!
I should know better...
but I wanted to finish this lesson!
